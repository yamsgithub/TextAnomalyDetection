Analysts predict Apple will launch its next iPhone in the fall, about a year after the 4S model. 
Expectations for Apple's stock are still lofty, with some analysts having 12-month price targets approaching $1,000 a share.
Over the quarter, the nearly five-year-old iPhone remained Apple's key driver. Apple said it sold 35.1 million of the smartphones, up from 18.65 million units a year ago. 
The device and related products and services formed 57.9% of Apple's sales, up from 52.7% last quarter. 
The company said its latest iPhone is now available in more than 100 countries and 230 wireless carriers, up from 186 carriers in 90 countries as of March last year.
